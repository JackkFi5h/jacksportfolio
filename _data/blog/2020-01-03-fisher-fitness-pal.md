# FisherFitnessPal

FisherFitnessPal is my very own fitness app, originally developed for my college coursework, it is my first fully fledged mobile application that encompasses a variety of fitness and dietary tracking functionalities. It was built in around 3 months using Xamarin Forms and has been extensively documented as required for my coursework.
